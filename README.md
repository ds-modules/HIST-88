In this course, students will explore the detainment and then internment of Japanese Americans within the United States during World War II. There were between 110,000 and 120,000 people who were forced into these internment camps during the span of four years from February 19, 1942 to March 20, 1946.

The module contains an assortment of Jupyter notebooks, SketchUp models, exercises, and tutorials that will not only walk you through the history of the fates of tens of thousands of Japanese Americans, but also make you understand how and where they were assigned - often estranged from their original homes and families.

All content was created by Melanie Yu, Andrew Linxie, Nga Pui Leung, and Francis Kumar. Raw sources referred to within the Python notebooks were downloaded from private sources.
